Responsive is better than fast
It’s not fully shipped until it’s fast
Anything added dilutes everything else
Practicality beats purity
Approachable is better than simple
Mind your words, they are important
Speak like a human
Half measures are as bad as nothing at all
Encourage flow
Non-blocking is better than blocking
Favor focus over features
Avoid administrative distraction
Design for failure
Keep it logically awesome
You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain
Hasta la vista, baby
Failure is not an option
The first rule of Fight Club is: you do not talk about Fight Club
